# Kanban Boards
A web app that helps users visualize their projects all in one place. You can create different boards containing columns and cards and drag cards across columns. In each of the task cards you can set deadlines, add descriptions and notes/comments about the task. You can color coat the tasks by different categories (e.g. red= urgent, blue= revist, green = easy etc.). You can also see a calendar view of your tasks, organized by deadlines.
